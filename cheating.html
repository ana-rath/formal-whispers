    While the question only pertained to in-exam cheating, the answer holds true for many form of cheating. Be it: using notes in an exam, getting extra marks from a teacher, peeking into your friends paper, and so on.



Irresepctive of how much you like your friend, cheating is wrong. In today's day and age, with increasing competition, Cheating has become a passing matter, and has been trivialised completely. 

<br> 

But before complaining to an authority figure, you should first confront your friend about it. Give him/her the opportunity to correct his mistake. To apologise to the teacher for cheating, to correct the teacher about the calculation mistake she made in his paper, or to even bring to light his cheating incident and pay the price for it. Give him this opportunity, and if he still doesn't own up, then approach your class teacher. Explain the situation to her, and ask her how to take it forward. 

<br>

But approach the offender first, and enlighten him (not in a threatening way) that your next option would be to approach a teacher.

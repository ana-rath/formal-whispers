      <h1> If I did badly in my prelims does that mean I'm going to do badly in my boards too?</h1>

    Absolutely not!
    <br> 
    You may have heard it a million times, but now you're hearing it from someone who's been through it. 
    <br> 
    The Prelims are hard, because it shows you the worst situation that you could be in (and also an unlikely one). It's important because it shows you which subjects and specific areas you should focus on in the one month study leave that you get. The last thing it should do to you is discourage you!
    <br> 
    It should have the opposite effect. If you did badly, you have a whole month (that is 30 days, 720 hours, 43200 minutes and 2,592,000 seconds) to get your mistakes corrected :) 
    <br> 
    That being said, this time also tends to fly by quickly, so make sure you don't waste it.

    However, relaxing is also important (make sure you don't burn out).

    Personal trivia from one of the writers:
<br> 

    I went for HMUN during my study leave and I think that was the best decision I've made. It gave me the 7 day break from my textbooks that I needed, and after coming back, I was pumped and ready to begin again.
    <br> 

    Try doing something similar (if you can't go for a MUN, take a 3-4 day break), but make sure you get back to it with all force as soon as the break is done :) 

<br>

    PS: The ICSE is a breeze, don't lose sleep over it.

      <h1> Should I take Economics or Business Management in the IB? </h1>
      
      <br>
      
When deciding between Economics and Business Management (BM) in the IB, the first is to understand the difference between the two.
<br> 
Economics deals with economic theories like Inflation, Recession, Balance of Payments, etc (Macroeconomics) and Consumer Choice, Supply and Demand (Microeconomics), and real world examples of this. It is more theoretical than BM. 
<br> 

Business Management deals with the working of specific firms, and the methords used by them like advertising, etc. It forms a better basis for further studies in Business. However, it is a known fact that in the UK, Business is considered a 'soft subject'.

      <h1> Should I take IB or ISC?</h1>
      
      <br> Aha! A much awaited question. 
<br>
      To start off with, it is imperitive to remember that both- IB and ISC are equally good. When making this choice- first consider what kind of person you are. If you're the type of person who has a creative side, you should choose the IB. Remember that in this programme, there is nothing like One-Word Answers or Short Answers. Almost all subjects, require you to write essay-type answers, which is a skill not many people have. So if you feel this skill is not intrinsic, do not choose the IB. Be prepared to tackle assignments which really require you to embrace your creative side, for example, you may have an assignment where you alter a scene of a Shakespeare play, write your own scene, or even write your own play. 
      <br>

      Secondly, remember that the IB is an extremely demanding curriculum with numerous submissions almost consecutively. If you are not a good time manager, then do not choose the IB. 
<br>
      Thirdly, the IB is interdiscplinary by nature, as Mathematics and one Science are complusory. If you think taking Math and even Science would be detrimental to you, as you are not made for that, then do not choose the IB. If you want to pursure studies overseas after the 12th, taking ISC does NOT put you at any disadvantage. ISC and APs (Advance Placement Programmes) have the same standing as the IB. To conclude, remember that you will not be at any disadvantage with the choice that you make, and what's more important is to do well in what you choose.

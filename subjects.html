      <h1> What subjects should I choose? Does any one subject help me get into college? </h1>
      
      <br> 
      
     <p>

    Choose your subjects based on 4 simple words which you should live by-
    Do what you like!
    Colleges don't want you to take a particular subject, they want you to take a subject you're passionate about.
    They look for one thing, and one thing only: Passion. 
    This being said, level of difficulty or ease shouldn't be the basis for you choosing your subjects. "This subject is easy" or "This subject is scoring" aren't acceptable reasons for choosing subjects. Before making your choice, ask yourself if this is something you would like to do for the next 2 years. 
    You don't have to have your whole career path planned out before you make a subject choice- just go by the heart, and you're bound to succeed.

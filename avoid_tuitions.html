      <h1> Study Tips: How can I avoid tuitions? </h1>
      
      <br> 
      
     <p>

    Your main aim should be trying to avoid tuitions as much as possible. Tuitions are simply a waste of time (and money!) You spend more time travelling, while this time could be spent in self study.
<br> 
    Self study is the only way to avoid tuitions, save time, and even improve your marks.
    It may sound cliched, but speaking from personal experience, if you come home and just revise what you did in school that very day, it helps a lot in the end. 
    <br> 
    Daily revision helps in clear thinking, better understanding of concepts, and  helps matter settle in the brain. Repeated revisions then help the matter settle in the hind brain, which is important for long term memory. This process strengthens conceptual understanding, making recall easy. 
    <br> 
    In simple words, 
    Don't start studying for a test the day before, you're bound to do badly, despite pulling that dreaded all-nighter :)

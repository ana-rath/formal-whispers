      <h1> I saw my friend being bullied the other day. What should I do?

Whenever someone gets bullied, and you've seen it happen, you obviously have two options: to expose the bully and complain, or to approach the bully.

<br>

Both options are scary, but to actually eliminate wrong from this world, you need to be brave.

<br> 

First, approach the bully. Tell him/her what he/she's doing is wrong. Explain why. Educate him/her on basic respect and human rights. If the bully still doesn't seem to agree, try talking to him/her to find out their motivation behind bullying: because all bullies have been bullied. Assure the bully that they are not alone, and they can't help themselves by bullying others. 

<br>

If they still don't understand, then approach an authority figure. You will NOT look like a coward for doing so, you are doing the right thing. Remember that. 

<br>

      <h1> Do my ICSE marks mean everything? </h1>
      

     <p>

    No!
    Contrary to popular belief, ICSE Marks are NOT the most important thing in your life.
    Undoubtedly, you should work hard, strive to do well, but most importantly, UNDERSTAND what you're studying. 
    You may have 2 marks cut in your Physics paper because a line wasn't dotted, but that doesn't mean you're dumb or you're bad at Physics. You should understand WHY the line is dotted, and know why it is imaginary. Physics is just one example, but this can be extended to many situations. 
    Whilst it IS imperative to do well in all your exams (as transcripts are sent to foreign colleges), it is important to know that your ICSE marks are not the be-all-and-end-all of this world. So do not stress, eat well, sleep well, and your exams will be a breeze!

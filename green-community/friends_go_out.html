      <h1> My friends go out every night. If I say no to a plan will they stop being my friend? </h1>
      

     <p>

    No! Cancelling on a few plans will not make your friends 'abandon' you. If your friends choose to go out every night, and insist that you come along, even when you want to stay home and relax/ study, then they are being bad friends. Sit down with them, explain to them how they should restrict their outings to weekends, or once every two weeks. If they choose not to listen to you, and stop talking to you, it's their loss!
    You should do what's best for you. Make other friends. Friends who respect your decisions. Come out of your comfort zone, sit with someone new in class, and talk to people who you don't usually talk to. Believe me, you'll be happier

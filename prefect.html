      <h1> I want to become a Prefect. What should I do?</h1>

    The most important thing to remember is that you shouldn't carry out actions with the aim of becoming a Prefect. 

<br>

A student is appointed Prefect if he/she can lead by example, upholds the values of integrity which the school stands for, and can adhere to as well as inspire other children to adhere to, the Code of Ethics.

<br>

So in essence, the only 'thing' you 'need' to do, if you want to become a Prefect, is be a good human being. Being ethical, empathetic and having integrity is something we all should embody, irrespective of being Prefect or not.

<br>

You should want to adopt these qualities to be a better human being, not to be a Prefect. 

<br>

Whispers clarifies rumours: 

<br>

No, being a 'MUN-ner' does NOT automatically qualify you for being a Prefect.
